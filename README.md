# IMDB-Datset-Algorithms
 Implementing 6 sorting algorithms (Insertion, Selection, Quick, Heap, Shell, Merge) in Python, comparing their performance on a real-world dataset.

	Project Description

Sorting is used time and again in many day-to-day life activities. While brute force way to sort is easy to build and simple to apply in any situation, the cost of implementing brute force increases exponentially as the size and complexity of the data increases. So, in this project, you will implement various algorithms to efficiently sort a real-world dataset. In particular, you will be implementing 6 sorting algorithms namely Insertion sort, Selection sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Shell sort, and Merge sort. And in addition, you will get to see how the time to compute differs for each algorithm. 
 
(1)	imdb_dataset.csv file

(2)	test_cases_1_2.csv file
This file contains a relatively smaller number of data samples than the ‘imdb_dataset.csv’ file since it will be only used for test case 1 and 2. 


•	Skeleton codes

(1)	sorting_algos.py 
This python skeleton code file has the functions defined for all the 6 sorting algorithms you will be implementing. Detailed comments are provided on what you need to code and where to write the code.  ‘Need to Code’ comments are provided at all places where you will need to code. 

(2)	mystery_sorting.py 
This python skeleton code file needs to be used to implement the last 3 test cases (test cases #13, #14, and #15). All the test cases and their implementation details are provided below. Comments on what you need to do and “Need to Code” comments are provided. Read the comments carefully and complete the code.


Mystery_Function.py
You will need to write code for test cases #13, #14, and #15 in the mystery_function.py file. Here, you have a memory limitation. Meaning that now you can only load 2,000 data samples at a time. Because of this limitation, you cannot sort the entire dataset at once.
